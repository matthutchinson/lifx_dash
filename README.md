*NOTE*: This gem repo is mostly boilerplate for now, and unfit for use until the first
formal release to Rubygems has been made.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be
able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file
`lib/lifx_dash`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lifx_dash'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lifx_dash

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
